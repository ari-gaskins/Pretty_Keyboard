# Pretty Keyboard

**Goal**: To make a pretty keyboard, and different color palettes for it. Also to have keys color change using JavaScript.

**Ideas**: 
    * starting as simple project, designing keyboard layout that is stylish and comfortable, keys can change color with button press using JavaScript
    * might turn into typing test app, with super chill vibes 
    * might add lofi beats based on different color palettes chosen
    * might add random words to be typed and registered for accuracy and speed
    * might add where if you type the wrong letter, the key will be a 'harsher' color in the palette, but letters will not show penalties
    * semi-inspired by monkeytype, less competitive, more vibes
    * takes into account the environment people may be in when typing, not competing but chilling on their computer like any other old day. idea is to help people speed up their baseline typing speed, not their high stress typing speed.
    * minimalist vibes  

**Color** **Palettes**:
    * baby blues (color palette #645):  #176582 #5590b4 #c2efff #c3b7ac #e0c07b (bottom to top)
    * beach day (color palette #425): #ffffff #cbc7bd #b6a290 #856951 #cf6120 (bottom to top)
    * orchid field (color palette #544): #3c1e6c #884389 #af7480 #f3f0dd #626b1e (right to left)
    * hacker green: #20c20e
    * hacker light blue: #05b0ff, hacker dark blue: #243c55

**Loose Tasks**: 
    [x] add font-families
    [] write script to add interactivity to buttons
    [x] upload to github
    [x] figure out how to setup hrefs with javascript functionality
    [x] maybe make colors into a navbar setup?
    [x] figure out how to make it look cleaner
    [] make color button change color palette
    [] setup typing test functionality
    [x] setup timer modes as dropdown menu in navbar
    [] find toggle (switch or button)
    [] want a toggle-able timer (hidden or visible)
    [] add styles for timer features
    [] make navbar grid for better organization
    [] bonus: endless timer mode that can be ended with esc key
    [x] might make settings into a hidden menu later
    [] write unit tests for main.js (will have to do after to spend time learning)
